ðŸŽ¬ Movie Website
A simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript movie website that stores and renders user interest data from a JSON file.
Users can browse posts (movies), click to view details, and all content is dynamically loaded from JSON â€” no backend required.

ðŸš€ Features
Static Frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
JSON-based data storage for movies and user interest
Auto-render movie list from JSON
Dynamic detail page when a user clicks on a movie
No database needed â€” all data in a local JSON file

ðŸ”§ How It Works
Load Data â€“ script.js fetches data.json and renders movie cards on index.html
Click Movie â€“ Clicking a movie sends the id in the URL query string
Render Detail Page â€“ movie.html fetches the same JSON and loads that specific movieâ€™s details
User Interest â€“ Optional: Store liked movies in localStorage or a separate JSON
